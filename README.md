Week 11 Challenge Working with ES6 and Node.js

# Module 11 Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Your Task

Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Good README Guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Good-README-Guide/README.md) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
  * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
    * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
    * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
    * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
    * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README

## Getting Started

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

	* Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
